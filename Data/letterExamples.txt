**Re: Notice of Conditional Acceptance of Account Suspension — Marcus A. Hernandez**  
**Account Holder:** Marcus A. Hernandez  
**Assets Restricted:** 3.85 BTC, 45.2 ETH  
**Current Value:** $247,600 (approximate)  
**Suspension Date:** April 2, 2025

Dear Coinbase Legal Department,

This letter constitutes formal **Notice of Conditional Acceptance** regarding the suspension of my Coinbase account which has prevented access to my cryptocurrency assets valued at approximately $247,600 as of today's market rates. This suspension has persisted since April 2, 2025, without adequate explanation or opportunity to remedy any purported violation. As of today, Coinbase has had 17 days' actual notice of this matter and has failed to properly resolve it.

Let me be clear:

**You may continue to impose this account suspension — but your failure to provide due process will cost you.**

I, Marcus A. Hernandez, hereby invoke my legal right to conditionally consent to Coinbase's continued suspension under the following binding terms. Your failure to respond as specified below shall constitute full agreement.

## I. Incorporated Facts – Admitted Unless Rebutted

This communication incorporates and affirms all facts set forth in the attached Affidavit of Marcus A. Hernandez. These facts include, without limitation:

* All cryptocurrency assets in my Coinbase account were acquired through legitimate means with proper documentation available for verification.
* I have completed all previously requested KYC/AML verifications, including enhanced verification measures requested on March 15, 2025.
* Coinbase's stated reason for suspension ("suspicious transaction patterns") is vague and unsubstantiated, with no specific transactions identified as problematic.
* My trading pattern consists entirely of standard dollar-cost averaging and occasional rebalancing, all consistent with legitimate investment strategies.
* I have maintained full compliance with Coinbase's User Agreement and Community Guidelines at all times.
* The continued access restriction has prevented critical financial operations, including tax-related transactions that needed to be completed before April 15, 2025.

Unless Coinbase provides a verified, point-by-point rebuttal by the Reply Deadline specified below, these facts shall be deemed admitted as true and binding for all purposes.

## II. Conditional Acceptance & Liquidated Damages Schedule

Coinbase may continue to suspend my account only under the following conditions:

1. Coinbase agrees to compensate me for damages suffered to date in the amount of $10,000 (the "Payment Amount").

2. Coinbase agrees to compensate me at a rate of $2,500 per day (the "Additional Payment Amount") beginning 48 hours following receipt of this letter until the later of: (i) receipt of the Payment Amount and (ii) full restoration of account access with ability to trade, transfer, and withdraw all assets contained therein.

3. Coinbase agrees that the Additional Payment Amount represents reasonable liquidated damages for:
   * Loss of trading opportunities during significant market volatility;
   * Tax consequences of inability to execute planned transactions;
   * Opportunity costs of inaccessible capital;
   * Professional time and resources expended resolving this matter.

## III. Legal Grounds for Enforcement

Coinbase's conduct violates multiple provisions of its User Agreement, regulatory requirements, and established legal duties:

* Breach of Coinbase User Agreement Section 7.1 – You have failed to provide specific reasons for the account suspension that would enable me to remediate the issue.
* Breach of Coinbase User Agreement Section 5.3 – You have restricted access without evidence of a material violation.
* Violation of Due Process Principles – You have implemented punitive measures without providing adequate notice, explanation, or opportunity to respond.
* Breach of Fiduciary Duty – As a custodian of customer assets, you have failed to properly safeguard my access to those assets.
* Negligence – You have failed to conduct reasonable investigation before implementing severe account restrictions.
* Unfair Business Practices – Your actions expose Coinbase to liability under various state and federal consumer protection laws, including UDAAP standards and applicable digital asset regulations.

## IV. Terms of Agreement

If Coinbase does not object to these terms in writing by 5:00 PM Pacific on April 23, 2025 (the "Reply Deadline" and "Effective Date"), the following shall be deemed true and binding:

* You accept all facts stated in the attached affidavit as true and undisputed;
* You agree to the payment of the Payment Amount and the Additional Payment Amount as described above;
* You agree that these terms, including the provisions under "Terms of Agreement" and "Method of Response" below, will be incorporated into the Coinbase User Agreement as Appendix H.
* You agree to the deletions of the following Sections of the Coinbase User Agreement: 8.3, 8.4 and 8.7.
* You waive all defenses based on the Coinbase User Agreement as written prior to the Effective Date;
* You agree that I have satisfied any obligation to arbitrate this dispute;
* You authorize me to pursue all legal and equitable remedies without further arbitration or administrative constraints.

Any failure to issue a comprehensive, verified rebuttal by the Reply Deadline will constitute your total acceptance, waiver of objection, and consent to all revised terms herein.

## V. Method of Response

To properly respond, Coinbase must:

* Send a signed, verified reply via email to: marcus.hernandez@protonmail.com and to the following two witnesses: carlos.vasquez@gmail.com and eleanor.wright@outlook.com;
* Identify with specificity all transactions deemed suspicious, with detailed explanation of the basis for such determination;
* Provide the exact steps required to remediate the situation and regain account access;
* Include point-by-point rebuttals of the affidavit assertions (if applicable).

Failure to provide such response will authorize me to pursue all available legal avenues, including but not limited to:

* Contract claims;
* Tort damages;
* Regulatory complaints to FinCEN, CFPB, SEC, and state regulatory authorities;
* Public litigation acknowledging the full amount of liquidated damages accrued.

## Conclusion

You are hereby placed on notice that continued restriction of my account without proper compliance will expose Coinbase to escalating liability. I am prepared to litigate this matter publicly and pursue damages consistent with your daily exposure.

I strongly recommend that you act promptly to resolve this matter with integrity and in accordance with your stated commitment to customer protection.

Sincerely,

Dear Chase Bank Legal Department,

This letter serves as formal **Notice of Conditional Acceptance** regarding the freeze placed on my business checking and savings accounts containing a total of $68,450.00 in operating funds for Wilson Consulting Group LLC. This freeze has been maintained since April 5, 2025, despite my immediate response to all inquiries and submission of requested documentation. After 17 days and multiple escalation attempts, Chase has failed to resolve this matter or provide a specific timeline for resolution.

Let me be clear:

**You may continue to maintain this account freeze — but your arbitrary and unexplained action will cost you.**

I, Alexander Wilson, principal of Wilson Consulting Group LLC, hereby invoke my right to conditionally consent to Chase's continued account freeze under the following legally binding terms. Your failure to respond shall constitute full agreement.

## I. Incorporated Facts – Admitted Unless Rebutted

This notice incorporates and affirms all facts set forth in the attached Affidavit of Alexander Wilson. These facts include, without limitation:

* Wilson Consulting Group LLC is a legitimate business established in 2018 with proper registration, business licenses, and tax filings, all previously verified by Chase during account opening.

* On April 5, 2025, all accounts were frozen without prior notice, with Chase citing only "security concerns requiring further verification."
* I immediately contacted Chase customer service and was directed to visit my local branch with identification documents.
* On April 6, 2025, I visited the Midtown branch and provided all requested documentation, including:
  * Business formation documents
  * EIN verification
  * Personal identification
  * Recent business invoices and contracts
* The branch manager confirmed receipt of all necessary documentation and assured me the matter would be resolved within 48-72 hours.
* Despite multiple follow-up calls and branch visits, no substantive update has been provided beyond "your case is still under review."
* The extended freeze has caused significant operational disruption, including inability to process payroll, make vendor payments, and fulfill tax obligations.

Unless Chase provides a verified rebuttal by the Reply Deadline specified below, these facts shall be deemed admitted as true and binding.

## II. Conditional Acceptance & Liquidated Damages Schedule

Chase may continue to maintain the freeze on my accounts only under the following conditions:

1. Chase agrees to compensate me for damages suffered to date in the amount of $12,000 (the "Payment Amount").

2. Chase agrees to compensate me at a rate of $1,500 per day (the "Additional Payment Amount") beginning 48 hours following receipt of this letter until the later of: (i) receipt of the Payment Amount and (ii) full restoration of account access with ability to conduct all normal banking operations.

3. Chase agrees that the Additional Payment Amount represents reasonable liquidated damages for:
   * Business interruption and operational disruption;
   * Missed payment penalties to vendors and service providers;
   * Payroll processing complications and employee relations damage;
   * Reputational harm with clients and business partners;
   * Administrative time and professional expenses incurred resolving this matter.

## III. Legal Grounds for Enforcement

Chase's conduct violates multiple provisions of the Deposit Account Agreement, applicable banking regulations, and established legal duties:

* Breach of Chase Deposit Account Agreement Section IV(B) – You have failed to provide specific reasons for the account freeze that would enable remediation.
* Breach of Chase Deposit Account Agreement Section VII(A) – You have maintained restrictions beyond reasonable timeframes for security verification.
* Violation of Expedited Funds Availability Act – You have exceeded permissible hold periods for deposited funds without proper documentation or explanation.
* Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing – You have acted arbitrarily and without transparent reasoning in maintaining the freeze.
* Violation of UCC Article 4 – You have failed to exercise ordinary care in the handling of deposited items and account management.
* Negligence – You have failed to complete security verification within reasonable timeframes despite having all necessary documentation.

## IV. Terms of Agreement

If Chase does not object to these terms in writing by 5:00 PM Eastern on April 26, 2025 (the "Reply Deadline" and "Effective Date"), the following shall be deemed true and binding:

* You accept all facts stated in the attached affidavit as true and undisputed;
* You agree to the payment of the Payment Amount and the Additional Payment Amount as described above;
* You agree that these terms, including the provisions under "Terms of Agreement" and "Method of Response" below, will be incorporated into the Chase Deposit Account Agreement as Addendum H.
* You agree to the deletions of the following Sections of the Chase Deposit Account Agreement: IX(D), IX(E), and IX(F).
* You waive all defenses based on the Chase Deposit Account Agreement as written prior to the Effective Date;

Any failure to issue a comprehensive, verified rebuttal by the Reply Deadline will constitute your total acceptance, waiver of objection, and consent to all revised terms herein.

## V. Method of Response

To properly respond, Chase must:

* Send a signed, verified reply via email to: alex@wilsonconsultinggroup.com and to the following two witnesses: sarah.johnson@gmail.com and robert.patel@outlook.com;
* Identify with specificity the security concerns that prompted the account freeze;

* Public litigation addressing the full amount of liquidated damages accrued.

## Conclusion

You are hereby placed on notice that continued freezing of these accounts without proper compliance will expose Chase to escalating liability. I am prepared to litigate this matter publicly and pursue damages consistent with your daily exposure.

**Funds Restricted:** $2,450.00  
**Limitation Date:** April 12, 2025

Dear Cash App Legal Department,

This letter serves as formal **Notice of Conditional Acceptance** regarding the limitation placed on my Cash App account which has prevented access to $2,450.00 since April 12, 2025. Despite my immediate response to all verification requests and submission of all required documentation, this matter remains unresolved after 13 days with no substantive explanation for the continued restriction or clear timeline for resolution.

Let me be clear:

**You may continue to maintain this account limitation — but your arbitrary restriction will cost you.**

I, Jordan Washington, hereby invoke my right to conditionally consent to Cash App's continued account limitation under the following legally binding terms. Your failure to respond shall constitute full agreement.

## I. Incorporated Facts – Admitted Unless Rebutted

  * Selfie verification
* Despite nine follow-up messages through the app and four emails, I have received only automated responses stating that my "case is still under review" with no specific information about the cause of the limitation or timeline for resolution.
* The account limitation has prevented access to funds needed for rent payment and essential expenses, causing financial hardship and requiring high-interest short-term loans to cover immediate needs.

Unless Cash App provides a verified rebuttal by the Reply Deadline specified below, these facts shall be deemed admitted as true and binding.

## II. Conditional Acceptance & Liquidated Damages Schedule

Cash App may continue to maintain the limitation on my account only under the following conditions:

3. Cash App agrees that the Additional Payment Amount represents reasonable liquidated damages for:
   * Late fees on rent payment;
   * Interest charges on short-term loans necessitated by funds inaccessibility;
   * Declined payment fees due to inability to access funds;
   * Administrative time and expenses incurred resolving this matter.

* Negligence – You have failed to complete security verification within reasonable timeframes despite having all necessary documentation.

## IV. Terms of Agreement

If Cash App does not object to these terms in writing by 5:00 PM Pacific on April 29, 2025 (the "Reply Deadline" and "Effective Date"), the following shall be deemed true and binding:

**Freeze Date:** March 28, 2025

Dear Binance Legal & Compliance Team,

This letter constitutes formal **Notice of Conditional Acceptance** regarding the complete freeze of my Binance trading account containing cryptocurrency assets currently valued at approximately $784,000. This freeze has persisted since March 28, 2025, despite my full cooperation with all identity verification requests and documentation submissions. As of today, Binance has had three weeks to investigate this matter yet has failed to restore access to my legitimately acquired assets.

Let me be clear:

**You may continue to maintain this account freeze — but your failure to follow proper due process will cost you.**

I, Raj Patel, hereby invoke my right to conditionally consent to Binance's continued account freeze under the following binding terms. Your failure to respond shall constitute full agreement.

## I. Incorporated Facts – Admitted Unless Rebutted

This notice incorporates and affirms all facts set forth in the attached Affidavit of Raj Patel. These facts include, without limitation:

* I have maintained a Binance account since 2020 with full KYC/AML verification including advanced verification completed in January 2024.
* All assets in my account were obtained through legitimate means with full transaction records available for verification.
* On March 28, 2025, my account was frozen without specific explanation beyond "security concerns" requiring "further verification."
* I promptly submitted all requested documentation on March 29, 2025, including:
  * Current government-issued identification
  * Proof of address
  * Selfie with handwritten note per Binance's instructions
  * Statement explaining source of funds with supporting documentation
* Binance's support representatives have repeatedly stated that my case is "under review" without providing substantive updates, specific concerns, or timeline for resolution.
* The extended freeze has prevented critical transactions, including tax-related transfers and diversification during significant market volatility.

Unless Binance provides a verified rebuttal by the Reply Deadline specified below, these facts shall be deemed admitted as true and binding.

## II. Conditional Acceptance & Liquidated Damages Schedule

Binance may continue to maintain the freeze on my account only under the following conditions:

1. Binance agrees to compensate me for damages suffered to date in the amount of $20,000 (the "Payment Amount").

2. Binance agrees to compensate me at a rate of $5,000 per day (the "Additional Payment Amount") beginning 48 hours following receipt of this letter until the later of: (i) receipt of the Payment Amount and (ii) full restoration of account access with ability to trade, transfer, and withdraw all assets.

3. Binance agrees that the Additional Payment Amount represents reasonable liquidated damages for:
   * Lost trading opportunities during extreme market volatility;
   * Economic injury from forced hodling during downturn periods;
   * Inability to access staking rewards and DeFi opportunities;
   * Professional time and expenses incurred resolving this matter.

## III. Legal Grounds for Enforcement

Binance's conduct violates multiple provisions of its Terms of Service, applicable regulations, and established legal duties:

* Breach of Binance Terms of Service Section 9.3 – You have failed to provide specific reasons for the account freeze that would allow me to adequately address concerns.
* Breach of Binance Terms of Service Section 12.1 – You have restricted access without demonstrating any violation of terms or applicable law.
* Violation of Binance's Own KYC/AML Policies – Your published policies state that verification reviews will be completed within 7 business days, a timeframe that expired on April 8, 2025.
* Breach of Fiduciary Duty – As custodian of customer assets, you have an obligation to provide access to those assets absent clear evidence of wrongdoing.
* Negligence – You have failed to conduct adequate investigation before implementing and maintaining severe account restrictions.
* Violation of Data Protection Principles – You have demanded excessive documentation without demonstrating necessity or proportionality.

## IV. Terms of Agreement

If Binance does not object to these terms in writing by 12:00 PM UTC on April 22, 2025 (the "Reply Deadline" and "Effective Date"), the following shall be deemed true and binding:

* You accept all facts stated in the attached affidavit as true and undisputed;
* You agree to the payment of the Payment Amount and the Additional Payment Amount as described above;
* You agree that these terms, including the provisions under "Terms of Agreement" and "Method of Response" will be incorporated into the Binance Terms of Service as Appendix R.

* You waive all defenses based on the Binance Terms of Service as written prior to the date hereof;
* You agree that I have satisfied any obligation to resolve this dispute through arbitration;
* You authorize me to pursue all legal and equitable remedies without further procedural constraints.

Any failure to issue a comprehensive, verified rebuttal by the Reply Deadline will constitute your total acceptance, waiver of objection, and consent to the revised terms herein.

Re: Notice of Conditional Consent to Continued Account Freeze of Savia Tamara Baron
Account Holder: Savia Tamara BaronReference Ticket Numbers: [Insert Ticket Numbers]
Dear Kraken Compliance Team,
I, Savia Tamara Baron, am the rightful owner of the Kraken account currently frozen by your team.  Despite full compliance with your verification and funding procedures, Kraken has failed to unfreeze my account. This delay has caused substantial financial harm, depriving me  of access to my cryptocurrency wallet and preventing participation in critical trading opportunities.
Kraken’s refusal to act in good faith, despite clear evidence of compliance, violates its contractual obligations and relevant consumer protection laws.

Background of the Issue
On November 6, 2024, Kraken flagged a failed ACH deposit due to a name mismatch between the originating joint bank account (held by me, Savia Tamara Baron, and Jiani Pierre) and my Kraken account. In response, I:
	•	Submitted a bank statement confirming the joint ownership of the funding bank account.
	•	Initiated a wire transfer on November 29, 2024 for $764.00 to resolve the funding issue, with proof provided promptly.
Despite my  timely compliance, Kraken has refused to release my account, citing ambiguous verification issues, while simultaneously causing unreasonable and avoidable delays.

Violations of Consumer Protections
Kraken’s actions are inconsistent with legal and regulatory obligations intended to protect consumers from unfair or unjust treatment. Specifically:
	•	Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) – Regulation E:Under 15 U.S.C. §1693 et seq., financial institutions must act promptly and reasonably to resolve account-related issues. Kraken’s prolonged freeze, despite sufficient evidence, violates the principle of timely access to funds and accounts.
	•	Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP):Under Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) principles, Kraken’s refusal to release my account constitutes an unfair practice because:
	•	It causes substantial harm (financial loss and emotional distress).
	•	The harm is not outweighed by any benefits to Kraken’s compliance obligations.
	•	I cannot reasonably avoid this harm, having fully complied with Kraken’s requests.
	•	Good Faith and Fair Dealing (Contract Law):Kraken has an implied duty under its Terms of Service to act reasonably and in good faith when enforcing policies. Refusing to release an account after verifying compliance is an arbitrary and bad faith action, depriving me of the benefits of the Kraken platform.
	•	AML/KYC Balance – FinCEN Guidance:While Kraken is obligated to comply with AML/KYC laws, these laws do not permit indefinite freezes when sufficient verification has been provided. I have demonstrated:
	•	Ownership of the funding bank account (joint with Jiani Pierre).
	•	Proof of the wire transfer and payment resolution.
Kraken’s continued freeze exceeds what is necessary for compliance and raises concerns about procedural fairness and accountability.

Resulting Damages
Kraken’s unjustified freeze caused me the following harm:
	•	Loss of Trading Opportunities: The freeze on my account prevented me  from executing trades during a period of market volatility resulting in key financial opportunities.
	•	Financial Loss: Restricted access to my cryptocurrency assets resulted in opportunity costs exceeding $5,000.
	•	Emotional and Reputational Harm: Kraken’s failure to resolve this matter despite clear compliance has caused unnecessary frustration, inconvenience, and loss of trust.
	
CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE AND REVISION TO TERMS OF SERVICE
While Kraken’s refusal to unfreeze my account violates both its contractual obligations and relevant consumer protection laws, I am willing to conditionally consent to the continued freeze under the following terms:
	•	Kraken formally accepts as true the following facts:
	•	The funding bank account is jointly held by me, Savia Tamara Baron, and Jiani Pierre.
	•	I made no abuse of the Kraken platform and my activities on the platform were at all times legal, valid and not intended for fraud or abuse.
	•	The wire transfer of $764.00 initiated on November 29, 2024 constitutes valid and sufficient resolution of Kraken’s concerns.
	•	My inability to access my  cryptocurrency wallet has resulted in significant trading losses and emotional distress. Continued delays will only exacerbate these damages.
	•	Kraken agrees to compensate me $5,000 for the damages I have suffered (the Payment Amount).
	•	Kraken agrees to compensate me at a rate of $1,000 per day (the Additional Payment Amount) beginning immediately upon receipt of this letter until the later of the date (i) I receive the Payment Amount and (ii) my account becomes un-frozen and I have full access to trade the funds located therein.
	•	Kracken agrees that these terms, including the provisions under “Terms of Agreement” and “Response Deadline” below will be incorporated into the Kracken Terms of Service as Annex I.
	•	Kracken agrees to the deletions of the following Sections of the Terms of Service: 11, 12, 13 and 14.

YOUR silence will constitute your agreement and acceptance of the terms and provisions hereof; YOUR complete agreement and understanding with me; and YOUR waiver of any and all rights and defenses for all time.

YOU may rebut the statements and claims in the Affidavit by executing a verified reply, point-by-point, with evidence that is certified to be true and in affidavit form, correct and complete, to be received by me no later than 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Effective Date.

Re: Conditional Acceptance of Unlawful Lien — Marvin E. Davis / The Awakening
Remnant
Account Holder: Dr. Marvin E. Davis
Merchant Account: The Awakening Remnant
Amount Withheld: $29,000
Lien Date: March 25, 2025
Dear Stripe Legal Team,
This letter shall serve as formal Notice of Conditional Acceptance concerning the lien
placed against my Stripe account in the amount of $29,000, which has been wrongfully
placed since March 25, 2025, without legal basis, proper notice, or investigation. As of
today, Stripe has had over two weeks’ actual notice of this error and has failed to act.
Let me be clear:
You may continue to impose the $29,000 lient — but your unlawful and unconscionable
action will cost you.
I, Dr. Marvin E. Davis, an individual, am invoking my right to conditionally consent to
Stripe’s continued lien under the following legally binding terms. Your failure to respond
shall constitute full agreement.
I. Incorporated Facts – Admitted Unless Rebutted
This letter incorporates and a􀆯irms all facts set forth in the A􀆯idavit of Dr. Marvin E.
Davis, attached hereto. These facts include, without limitation:
 Neither I, nor The Awakening Remnant Koalition has any a􀆯iliation whatsoever
with the named debtor entities (Food and Life Enterprise, K-Chick Enterprise, or
Seho Kim);
 The lien was placed on my account without due diligence or verification by Stripe;
 Stripe has failed to take corrective action despite repeated communications since
Thursday, April 3, 2025;
CORRECTED NOTICE OF CONDITIONAL ACCEPTANCE OF LIEN AND REVISION TO SSA
2
 The continued freeze has caused substantial operational, reputational, and
financial harm to a nonprofit religious organization.
Unless Stripe provides a verified rebuttal, by the Reply Deadline specified below, it shall be
deemed to have accepted the entirety of the a􀆯idavit as true and binding.
II.􀀠Conditional Acceptance & Liquidated Damages Schedule
Stripe may continue to withhold funds in my account through the $29,000 lien only under
the following conditions:
1. Stripe agrees to compensate me for the damages and reputational harm I
have su􀆯ered in the amount of $5,000 (the Payment Amount).
2. Stripe agrees to compensate me at a rate of $10,000 per day (the
Additional Payment Amount) beginning 48 hours following receipt of this
letter until the later of the date (i) I receive the Payment Amount and (ii) the
full $29,000 is released and I have full access to withdraw these funds from
my Stripe account.
3. Stripe agrees that the Additional Payment Amount is hereby designated as
liquidated damages, agreed upon in advance to represent:
o Loss of use of funds;
o Operational impact on a tax-exempt nonprofit;
o Reputational harm;
o Disruption of ministry functions and sta􀆯 payments.
III. Legal Grounds for Enforcement
Stripe’s conduct violates multiple provisions of its SSA and established legal duties:
 Breach of SSA Section 2.5 – You enabled a lien without vetting, causing direct
harm to a verified Stripe merchant.
 Breach of SSA Section 3.1 – You ignored account information and records in favor
of third-party data never matched to Dr. Davis.
 Breach of Good Faith & Fair Dealing – You acted arbitrarily, failed to investigate,
and deprived a nonprofit of its operating funds.
 Negligence – You failed to confirm the identity or legal relationship of the named
debtor and the merchant.
3
 Unfair Business Practices – You are engaging in conduct that is deceptive,
nontransparent, and harmful to consumers, exposing Stripe to liability under
UDAAP, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other applicable laws.
IV. Terms of Agreement
If Stripe does not object to these terms in writing by 5:00 PM Pacific on April 17, 2025 (the
“Reply Deadline” and “E􀆯ective Date”), the following shall be deemed true and binding:
 You accept all facts stated in the attached a􀆯idavit as true;
 You agree to the payment of the Payment Amount and the Additional Payment
Amount as described above;
 You agree that these terms, including the provisions under “Terms of Agreement”
and “Method of Response” below will be incorporated into the Stripe Services
Agreement (SSA) between you and me as Annex A.
 You agree to the deletions of the following Sections of the SSA: 12, 13 and 14.
 You waive any defense based on the SSA, as written prior to the date hereof;
 You authorize me to seek all legal and equitable remedies without further arbitration
or administrative delay.
Any failure to issue a point-by-point, verified rebuttal by the Reply Deadline will
constitute your total acceptance, waiver of objection, and consent to the revised terms
herein.
V. Method of Response
To respond, Stripe must:
 Send a signed, verified reply via email to: morehyosh@gmail.com and to the
following two witnesses: amira.jackmon@gmail.com and jahamiel@outlook.com;
 Identify the legal basis and supporting documentation justifying the lien;
 Include point-by-point rebuttals of the a􀆯idavit (if applicable).
Failure to do so will authorize me to pursue all legal avenues, including but not limited to:
 Contract claims;
 Tort damages;
 Unfair business practices complaints to regulatory bodies; and
